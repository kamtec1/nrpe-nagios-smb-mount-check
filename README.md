# nrpe-nagios-smb-mount-check
Check mount SMB in windows via PowerShell

Script working witout PowerShell Admin profile.

Before using you need to change couple of things:
1. RemotePath
2. Username
3. Password
4. LocalPath - If you want to change/edit the latter 

Now you can ask it via NRPE (NAGIOS) and get the resoult :)

Good luck!

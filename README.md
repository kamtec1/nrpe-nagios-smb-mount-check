# nrpe-nagios-smb-mount-check
Check mount SMB in windows via PowerShell.
The main goal is to check and monitor mount.
P.S. There are more creative options to monitor it by writting a file and reading from it :))))))))

*Script working witout PowerShell Admin profile.*

Before using you need to change couple of things:
1. RemotePath
2. Username
3. Password
4. LocalPath - If you want to change/edit the latter 

Now you can ask it via NRPE (NAGIOS) and get the resoult :)


Good luck!
